# Summary
This was a project that I did for COSC 210 at my first year at UBCO it went poorly.

**Things I learned about making a software project:**
- Think about the GUI when making the classes 
- High Cohesion Low Coupling (keep that in mind when making a peice of software)
- Small progress is still progress (work a bit everyday dont leave to last second because you will incounter problems when making software that take time to fix)
- Plan more in beginning what the application will do (User stories are usefull)
- Set smaller sub goals on the way with a timeline to get it done. 

To run this application you run:

```java
java NEW_IDEA/Main/UI/GUI/ChessGame
```
and then the window will pop up

# Goal 
I want to create a game that is very simalar to chess but has a probabilsitic element to it. What this means is that a player on a given turn does not get to pick their piece, they get to roll two dice and from there the die will offer a player of a choice between two peices that they can move(or whatever they want if they roll doubles). The game ends when a players king is taken.

---

- **What will the application do?**
The application will be a game that users can play.
- **Who will use it?**
Hopefully anybody who wants to play a bit different version of chess. 
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
Because I like chess and I think it has a cool inheritance sturcture and the rules of the peices moving are intresting.
